# Power_BI_Projects
I've created a comprehensive Power BI project for e-commerce analytics. Let me summarize the key components of your project based on the information you've provided:

Data Source: E-commerce data

Visualizations (likely included):

Profit and loss by month analysis

Bar charts for top catagories

Bar charts for top customers

Bar charts for top States

Pie charts for top category distribution

Pie charts for PaymentMode distribution

Filters:
Quarter-based filter
State-based filter


This project seems to provide a comprehensive view of the e-commerce business, allowing users to analyze performance across different dimensions such as geography, time, and product categories.
The addition of filters by quarters and states enables more focused analysis and decision-making.
