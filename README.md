# Power_BI_Projects
I've created a comprehensive Power BI project for e-commerce analytics. Let me summarize the key components of your project based on the information you've provided:

**Data Source:** E-commerce data

**Visualizations (likely included):**
1. Profit and loss by month analysis
2. Bar charts for top catagories
3. Bar charts for top customers
4. Bar charts for top States
5. Pie charts for top category distribution
6. Pie charts for PaymentMode distribution

**Filters:**
1. Quarter-based filter
2. State-based filter

This project seems to provide a comprehensive view of the e-commerce business, allowing users to analyze performance across different dimensions such as geography, time, and product categories.
The addition of filters by quarters and states enables more focused analysis and decision-making.
